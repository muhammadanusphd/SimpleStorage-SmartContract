# SimpleStorage: Basic Ethereum Smart Contract

This is a minimal Solidity contract that stores and retrieves a single number on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates fundamental concepts like state variables, functions, and visibility.

## How to Test

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)  
2. Create a new file and paste the `SimpleStorage.sol` code.  
3. Compile the contract.  
4. Deploy it on the JavaScript VM (free simulated blockchain).  
5. Use the `set` function to store a number, and `get` to retrieve it.

## Why This Matters

Learning smart contracts is essential for blockchain development, and this project is a stepping stone to more advanced decentralized apps.
